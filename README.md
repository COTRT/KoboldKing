# KoboldKing
The Game:  Rise of the Kobold King.  Tremble before its majesty.

For the humble outsider looking in:  This is the product of a bunch of nerds in a nerd class (known as the Coders of the Round Table) producing fairly unskilled but awesome code.

For the Insider looking in:  _GET BACK TO WORK_

##A Brief Definition:
Kobolds are a figment of German Mithology.  We're creating a game around that.  It should be pretty awesome.

We're using Unity, Blender, and Visual Studio, except for the unfortunate fellows with Macs, who have been stuck with MonoDevelop.
